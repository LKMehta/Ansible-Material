Ansible: Tool used in Devops domain.

Ansible uses YAML (yet another markup language).

RedHat came out with a tool called Ansible.

It is basically used to do configuration management, application deployments, provisioning, rolling upgrades - CD(continuous deployment), security and compliance, orchestartion  (Use Cases).

Other tool similar to ansible are puppet, chef.

Ansible is simple and easy as comparision to puppet, chef.
SSH - secure shell
require python 2.4 and greater version.
On window platform it require (powershell 3.0 and above).

open source - free, no money involved.

Benefits
-------------------
1. efficient : Agentless, minimal setup
2. Fast  : Easy to learn/to remember, simple declarative language (YAML)
3. Scalable : Can managed thousands of nodes
4. secure : SSH transport
5. Large Community : thousands of roles on Ansible Galaxy

Roles : combination of group of playbooks

Key components
--------------------
1. Modules (Tools)
2. Tasks - also called as plays
3. Inventory - tells about the host machine that can be managed
4. Plays
5. Playbook (Plan)

Installation
----------------------------
#enable epel repo
yum install epel-release

#install ansible
yum install ansible

only 2 package management tool in linux - rpm(redhat package management), yum(yellowdog updater modifier)

rpm - it doesnot resolve dependencies (e.g. ansible require pyton 2.4 and above version)
yum - it resolves dependencies. it is rpm based package manager.

Modules 
-------------------
Bits of code copied to the target system. Executed to satisfy the task declaration.
Customizable

Common Module
Cloud Module, Network Module, Clustering Module, Notification Module

#is ansible available
ansible --version

#List all modules
ansible-doc -l

command "at" in linux helps in task scheduling

#view module documentation
ansible-doc <module name>

e.g ansible-doc command

any service end with d in  linux symbolize it is a daemon service

modules commonly used are
ping - check connection is established or not
apt/yum
copy
file
git
service
synchronize
template
uri
user
wait_for
get_url

------------------------------
installation steps:
------------------------------
install virtual box
install vagrant

install cmder

open cmder

to check vagrant version -> vagrant -v

www.vagrantup.com -> Find boxes -> Centos/7
go to a directory where you want the VagrantFile to be created

vagrant box add centos/7

Observe "vagrantFile" is created, by running ls command

vagrant init centos/7 (optional)

vagrant up
(the m/c (box) will be up & running)

vagrant halt (it will turn off)

vagrant ssh-config
(to view the configuration of the box --> list the ssh configuration details)

ssh vagrant@<IP Address> -p <port number> -i <identity file>
(-p port number, -i include identity file)

Now you will be able to work on centos machine.
ssh is the command to connect to this machine.

yum install -y ansible
or
sudo yum install -y ansible
(without -y it will ask for confirmation)

ansible --version

redhat, centos, fedora all have similar type of flavour

[vagrant@localhost ~]$
vagrant -> username
localhost -> host name
~ -> refers the home directory
pwd -> present working directory

configuration file can exist in your choice location.

in linux -> all config file are text file

to see the config file
ansible --version -> check config file path
cat <config file path> -> used just to view the file content
cat <config file path> | less
less-> it is a paginator

press spacebar(or up key) to go to next page, down key to come back to previous page, q to come out.

inventory file exists in /etc/ansible/hosts

usr represents -> user defined

#  -> used to comment the line

only super user and sudo user can install softwares

privilege escalation -> e.g if manager is absent, tech lead will take the control

paramiko -> is a module/plugin . To work on prior version of centos, it is mendatory that paramiko is working

touch ansible.cfg --> create an empty file

ansible --version --> config file destination file change

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ mkdir sg
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd sg
[vagrant@localhost sg]$

see ~ changed to sg

Ansible configuration file
---------------------------------
By default ansible looks for a configuration file in the following director : /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

However, we can have our own ansible config file in any directory : /home/rajesh/ansible.cfg

or, it could evne be in sub-directory :/home/rajesh/sg/ansible.cfg

The /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is called Global Configuration file.
It is provided by ANSIBLE and most of the options are commented.

We need to look into two groups [default] and [privilege_escalation] group and change the parameters as per needs.

The order in which ansible uses the config file is as follows :
1. If we have a config file in current directory it will use that or
2. It will use the default/global config file

e.g.
to rename the ansible config file : mv ansible.cfg myansible.cfg
ansible --version 
--> it's taking global config file
cd ..
ansible --version -> displays home directory config file

-----------------------------------------

Observe inventory file provided by ansible

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ # Observe inventory file provided by ansible
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts


----------------------------------------
ansible --help
or, ansible --help | less


ansible [hosts] {-i <inventory>} --list-hosts

ansible all --list-hosts

ansible localhost -m ping
ansible all -m ping
ansible local -m ping
ansible servera -m ping

ansible-doc -l | wc -l  ->> count the number of modules

ansible localhost -m  command -a "id" --> -a is argument, id is command -> gives user identification details
ansible localhost -m  command -a "uptime" -> up tells the up time i.e. from which time the server is up and running.
"set" command : display environmental variables

ansible localhost -m command -a "set" --> not work
ansible localhost -m shell -a "set" -> use shell command

cat ansible.cfg > output  --> copy the content to output file

the command with >, < use shell module, not command module

ansible-doc copy

ansible locahost -m copy -a "src=./output dest=/tmp"

in copy module content and source option are mutually exclusive'


---------------------------------------------

service module --> control services on remote hosts.

systemctl status sshd  -> d symbolise daemon process

systemctl status crond -> used to schedule task
systemctl stop crond

ansible localhost -m service -a "name=crond state=started"
ansible localhost -m service -a "name=crond state=stopped"

-------------------------------------------------

File module

ansible-doc file

ansible locahost -m file -a "path=/tmp/output mode=0400"

ansible locahost -m file -a "path=/tmp/output mode=0777"

VI Editor

VI Modes                                                             
======================                                               
VI editor works in two modes:                                        
1. the command mode (default)                                        
2. insert mode                                                       
                                                                     
to change over to insert mode, press the letter 'i' on the           
keyboard . Observe, -- INSERT -- at the bottom of the screen.        
It is a confirmation that we are in Insert mode.                     
                                                                     
To change over, from insert mode to Command mode, just press         
the ESC. If not sure, press the Esc ket more than once.              
                                                                     
Save Work                                                            
===============                                                      
Once you have done with the typing work, you can save and ...        
In command mode                                                      
                                                                     
 :w     To write                                                     
 :wq    To write and quit. i.e. come out of the editor.              
 :w <file> write to the file. (Similar to 'Save as')                 
 :q! Quit without saving                                             
                                                                     
Editing Commands

DAY 2
=========================================

SSH config file

 sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config --> edit the file as "PasswordAuthentication yes"
 sudo systemctl restart sshd 
 After this we can ping with any name : ansible local -i theHosts -m ping 

*to check if it is working or not
   ssh vagrant@localhost
 if it is asking for password : it means the permission set is correct

 After this we can ping with any name : ansible local -i theHosts -m ping 

 man ssh-copy id

Note : avoid spaces in path name

which python
python

  file_loc = "C:\new_folder\temp\ramya.txt" 
  print file_loc
  output: ew_folder       emp\john.txt         \n - newline character, \t - tab space  

----------------------------------------------------
Playbooks (written with YAML)
-------------

YAML : Ain't Markup language
lists like arrays                            

beginning of doc : three DASH (---)
end of doc : three DOT (...)

~ -> indicates home directory
file start with dot (.) is hidden file
vimrc - vi editor 

~/.vimrc

install vim enhanced tool
 sudo yum install -y vim-enhanced

can write string in single quotes, double quotes, without quotes. best practices : double quotes

lists
------------
e.g
-colors:
 - red
 - green
 - blue

inline :

fruits : [apple, banana, cherry]

comment line use #

verifying yAML syntax
 python -c 'import yaml, sys; print yaml.load(sys.stdin)' < <filename.yml> 

e.g.  python -c 'import yaml, sys; print yaml.load(sys.stdin)' < hello2.yml

hello2.yml
-----------
---
# Our first Hello Wolrd playbook
- name : First Play
  hosts : localhost
  tasks :
  - debug : msg="Hello from ANSIBLE"
  - debug : msg="Testing Once Again..."
Note : use vim editor (vim hello2.yml), donot use vi editor(view editor) since it opens the file in view mode not in edit mode



setup module : ansible localhost -m setup | less

Play : play serves 

execute playbook command
ansible-playbook <playbook file>

debug module -> ansible-doc debug --> prints statement during execution
                msg is used to display default message i.e. helloworld

ansible-doc -s debug  --> -s gives the small description

check playbook syntax : ansible-playbook --syntax-check <playbook_file>
step by step execution : ansible-playbook --step <playbook_file>
dry-run : ansible-playbook -C <playbook_file>


create file :  vim ~/.vimrc  ->: vim used since we have enhanced the vi editor using ->sudo yum install -y vim-enhanced -> text will be of different different color
open file : cat ~/.vimrc

----------------------------------

Variables in playbook
----------------------

e.g

vars :
  user : mukhtar

e.g. {{ variable_name }}

user module --> ansible-doc user

user details is available in /etc/passwd --> cat /etc/passwd
can't  create two user bu same name.

user add command used to create a user
user del command used to delete/remove a user

sudo userdel salman
cat /etc/passwd

if user already exist, playbook will not change it or create the duplicate one. since it has idempotent behaviour (i.e if exist, no change.. if doesnot exist, change happen)


ansible-playbook <playbook_file> -e "var=value"  ---> it will override the user variable value in playbook.

Instead varaible we can use array

----------------------
Register variable

We can capture the output of a command using the 'register' statement.

in vi editor we can execute any linux coomand by typing :!<command>  --> switch back to vi using enter key

Any tasks in playbbok fails, it will terminate the play book execution.
This issue can be resolved by handler.

check whether a weserver is existing or not --> systemctl status httpd


- name : Install a package and print the result         
  hosts : localhost

     register : install_result                          
                                                        
   - debug : msg="Display the installation result ..."  
   - debug : var=install_result     

- service:
    name: httpd
    state: started

systemctl status httpd

man wget : non interactive network downloader       
wget http://localhost/ravi.html  --> sudo install wget (used to install the wget)

/var/www/html/index.html

ansible localhost -m setup | less --> to search for hostname type /hostname and press enter key

after hosts in playbook you can write --> ignoreerror : yes


- lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    regexp: '^127\.0\.0\.1'
    line: '127.0.0.1 localhost'
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644

-------------------------------------
to execute task conditionally

when : condition variable

e.g register : status1

    when : status1.rc == 0
when clause is the last module of the task.

to supress the [Gathering facts activity]

below hosts in playbook type --> gather_facts : no  --> by default it execute the default module
                                 ignore_errors : yes

--------------------------------------
to iterate
 user :
  name : "{{ item }}"
  with_items :
   - amar
   - akbar
   - anthony

to delete user in cmder --> sudo deluser amar
             
ansible_all_ipv4_addresses

ansible_facts.ansible_all_ipv4_addresses
ansible_os_family
"ansible_pkg_mgr

wget work only when web server is up and running

----------------------------------------------------

DAY 3
====================================================

To restart the vagrant in cmder

Go to the folder containing vagrantFile.
Give command --> vagrant up
and then check the ssh configuration --> vagrant ssh-config
and then run this command --> ssh vagrant@<IP Address> -p <port number> -i <identity file>


-----------------------------------------------------

Conditionals
------------------------
achieved by association "when" keyword with a "conditional task"

in (operator) is used to check a pattern in string

Boolean :True/False

and (operator), or (operator)

Handlers  
-------------------------

To make changes to the machine, in order to reflect that changes machine should be restarted.

To notify to the handler, it uses the name attribute.

Note : when there is change i.e changes variable > 0, the only the handler is getting invoked.

Tags
-------------------------
 ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --tags 'tag_name'
 ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --skip-tags 'tag_name'
 ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --tags 'untagged'
 ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --tags 'tagged'
 ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --tags 'all'

e.g
ansible-playbook ex_tags.yml --skip-tags first

Managing Inclusions
----------------------
include_vars  <to specify the file to be included>
include <to specify the yml file which has tasks to be included>
|
--> include_tasks --> for dynamic inclusion (or) import_tasks --> for static inclusion.

to uninstall the package : sudo yum remove tree

 cat /etc/passwd | grep '^salman'

ansible-galaxy init --help

e.g. ansible-galaxy init --offline -f myenv   --> myenv is a directory name
     tree myenv/
cat myenv/vars/main.yml
cat myenv/tasks/main.yml
