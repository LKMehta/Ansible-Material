please keep in mind that the public key for root has to be on the server you want to reach as well, not only the public key from your non-root-user. Otherwise you get the error message above as well.

SOLUTION
========
As everybody else has already said you need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change PasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes

sudo systemctl restart sshd;
